    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ribeye steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>Fresh rosemary sprigs</li>
      <li>Fresh thyme sprigs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them come to room
        temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
      <li>
        Pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with
        salt and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat
        until it begins to smoke.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the steaks to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side
        until a golden-brown crust forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic, butter, rosemary, and thyme to the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the melted butter over the steaks as they cook for another minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook for an additional
        5-7 minutes for medium-rare, or longer if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the steaks to a cutting
        board. Let them rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the steaks against the grain and serve with your favorite side
        dishes.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy your delicious steak meal!</li>
