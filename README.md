### Files and Directories

- `index.html`: The homepage of the website, which includes links to individual recipe pages.
- `recipes/`: A directory containing HTML files for each recipe.

### Recipes

1. **Title**: The name of the recipe.
2. **Image**: An image of the finished dish.
3. **Description**: A brief description of the dish.
4. **Ingredients**: A list of ingredients needed for the recipe.
5. **Steps**: Step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish.
